# arduino-template

`arduino-template` is a starter repository for arduino development. It provides a pipeline for efficiently building, testing, and deploying your arduino sketches. Additionally over the long-term I'm hoping this can be a useful resource for people like me who have lots of experience programming, but have never in their lives done embedded system programming, or used microcontrollers.
